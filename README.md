# Air and space atlas

### Goal of the project
Welcome to a very early version of a extensive atlas for air and space travel.
The goal is to get a full system up and running that shows all the past and future air and space travel in a easy to use way.

### Current plans
At the moment we are in the initial design phase so the documentation will be very minimal.

### How to run it?
Clone or fork the repo and visual studio should be able to start immediately using the sln or csproj files.

### Copyright
At the moment you are free to use any part of the code but keep in mind that i don't own the dependencies.
This could change in the future but this is unlikely.

### Future availability
In the future there is a small change that (some of) the code will be removed or moved to a private repository because of privacy or security concerns.
There are no plans for this at the moment though.
